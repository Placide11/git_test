  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 large russet potatoes</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Start by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into evenly sized sticks or wedges.</li>
    <li>Rinse the potato sticks under cold water to remove excess starch, then pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep fryer or a large pot over medium-high heat. The oil should be about 350°F (175°C).</li>
    <li>Carefully add a batch of potato sticks to the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry them in batches if necessary.</li>
    <li>Fry the potatoes for about 5-6 minutes or until they turn golden brown and crispy.</li>
    <li>Using a slotted spoon or tongs, remove the fries from the oil and transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle salt over the freshly fried French fries while they're still hot.</li>
    <li>Repeat the frying process with the remaining potato sticks.</li>
    <li>Your homemade French fries are now ready to be enjoyed!</li>
