    <li>For the Bolognese sauce:</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 celery stalk, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup red wine (optional)</li>
    <li>1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>For the béchamel sauce:</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups milk</li>
    <li>Salt and nutmeg to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are soft and fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef to the pan and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon.</li>
    <li>If using, pour in the red wine and let it simmer until most of the liquid evaporates.</li>
    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let the sauce simmer for at least 1 hour to develop the flavors.</li>
    <li>In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for a minute, stirring constantly.</li>
    <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Cook the sauce until it thickens, then season with salt and nutmeg.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Cook the lasagne noodles according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Assemble the lasagne by spreading a layer of Bolognese sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagne noodles, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce. Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of béchamel sauce on top.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagne.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, or until the lasagne is bubbling and golden brown on top.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    <li>Slice the lasagne into portions and serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
